    "Hi everyone! I wanted to explore Slang and Informal Language with various LLMs. I decided to focus my time on Gemini, since I knew it would be caught up on current events. The specific event I want to discuss is the current rap beef between Kendrick Lamar and Drake. This rap war is a hot topic of conversation, so I was able to explore Gemini's takes and see how well it is familiar with cultural spectacles. The slang was very basic, but I expected it to be more cringe worthy. Moreover, I want to experiment more with specific dialects like DMV stang, to see of LLMs can understand and respond. "
