    "**Explanation:**\n",

    "Since we are just talking about distance from Chicago it doesn't matter what direction they are going.\n",
    "The speed of each train and the head start the first train had is what matters. \n",

    "The first train's distance can be represented with the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**60 + 60x** \n",
    "\n",
    "- it has an hour head start where it traveled 60 miles in that time\n",
    "\n",
    "The second train's distance can be represented with the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**80x** \n",
    "- each hour it travels 80 miles.\n",
    "  \n",
    "*In both equations x represents the number of hours.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we set these two equations equal to each other we get:\n",
    "60 + 60 x = 80 x\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine like terms:\n",
    "60 = 20 x\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide both sides by 20:\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "So at 3:00 p.m. The two trains will both be the same distance from Chicago (240 miles)."

In conclusion, the two trains will be the same distance from Chicago at 3:00 PM. Remember that the first train had a 1-hour head start, so it will have traveled further at that time (240 miles) compared to the second train (240 miles)."
