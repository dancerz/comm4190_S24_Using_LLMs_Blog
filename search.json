    "section": "",
    "text": "I graduate next week and I need two dresses. I currently have one, but I would like options. I am hoping that AI will assist me in my search process by providing possible websites and options. I began with Gemini and ChatGPT, but realized that Gemini could supply physical links to possible products. This Blog Post documents my conversations with LLM’s to improve my shopping experience.\nPrompt:\nI am graduating from college and I need to find a white dress. Make a list of places I can use to shop online. My Budget is $375, but I would ideally want to buy two dresses. I need fast shipping and quality options. \n\n\nHere are some online stores you can check out to find white graduation dresses with fast shipping and quality options, keeping in mind your budget of $375 for two dresses:\nLulu’s offers a wide range of graduation dresses, including white ones, that are all under $375. They have a large selection of styles to choose from, so you’re sure to find something that you love. Plus, they offer fast shipping options, so you can get your dress in time for graduation.\nhttps://www.lulus.com\nShowpo is another great option for affordable graduation dresses. They have a large selection of white dresses in a variety of styles, all for under $375. They also offer fast shipping options, so you can get your dress in time for graduation. Opens in a new window\nhttps://www.showpo.com\nASOS is a great place to find trendy and stylish graduation dresses. They have a wide variety of white dresses in a variety of styles, all for under $375. They also offer fast shipping options, so you can get your dress in time for graduation.\nhttps://www.asos.com/us/\nReformation offers sustainable and well-made dresses that are perfect for graduation. They have a smaller selection of white dresses, but the ones they do have are all beautiful and well-made. While some of their dresses might be outside your budget on their own, with strategic shopping you could find two that fit the bill. Their shipping times are also generally quite fast.\nhttps://www.thereformation.com\nRent the Runway is a great option if you want to wear a designer dress for graduation without breaking the bank. They have a large selection of white dresses from top designers, and you can rent them for a fraction of the retail price. Their dresses tend to be more on the high-end and may not all fit within your budget, but it’s worth checking out their selection, especially if you know exactly what designer dress you want.\nhttps://www.renttherunway.com\nHere are some tips for shopping for graduation dresses online:\nRead the reviews: Before you buy a dress, be sure to read the reviews from other customers. This can help you get a sense of the quality of the dress and the sizing.\nOrder a size up: If you’re between sizes, it’s always better to order a size up. You can always have the dress altered to fit you perfectly.\nConsider the return policy: Make sure you know the return policy before you buy a dress. This way, you can be sure that you can return the dress if it doesn’t fit or if you don’t like it. Shop early: The closer you get to graduation, the more likely it is that dresses will sell out. So be sure to start shopping early so that you have a wider selection to choose from.\n  I want something more unique, classy, and quality. I want to be able to wear these dresses again. I am open to vintage and designer options as well. My favorite option out of the ones supplied is Reformation.\nSince you’re looking for classy, high-quality white dresses that you can wear again, here are some refined options that cater to your preferences and budget:\nReformation (Budget-friendly designer)** is a perfect choice! They focus on sustainable, well-made dresses with classic silhouettes that can easily transition to other events. Here are some ways to maximize your budget:\nFocus on the Sale Section: Reformation has a dedicated sale section where you might find hidden gems at a discounted price. Look for dresses made from high-quality materials like silk or linen that would normally be outside your budget. Department Store Luxury Options: Many department stores have dedicated designer sections where you can find dresses within your budget, especially if you consider pre-owned:\nwww.nordstrom.com Nordstrom online store has a great selection of contemporary and designer dresses. Consider their “pre-owned” section where you might find gently used designer dresses for a fraction of the original price. They also offer free shipping and returns which can be helpful!\nwww.premiumoutlets.com Bloomingdale’s online store similar to Nordstrom, Bloomingdale’s offers a wide range of designer dresses. They also have a pre-owned section where you can find gently used designer pieces at a significant discount. They offer free shipping and returns on most orders.\nwww.saksfifthavenue.com Saks Fifth Avenue online store might have some options outside your budget, but they are known for their designer selection, and occasionally have sales that can bring the price down. It’s worth checking out their website or app, especially during special promotions. Vintage Websites:\nThe RealReal RealReal online store is a curated marketplace for pre-owned luxury goods. You can find a great selection of vintage designer dresses here, and they authenticate everything before it’s listed for sale. While some dresses may be above your budget, with strategic searching you might find the perfect dress at a significant discount. Things to Consider When Shopping Online for Vintage or Designer Dresses:\nMeasurements: Pay close attention to the measurements listed for the dress. Since you can’t try it on beforehand, ensure the measurements align well with yours. Condition: When shopping pre-owned, be sure to read the description carefully about the condition of the dress. Look for high-quality photos that allow you to see the details of the dress. Return Policy: Check the return policy before you buy, especially when shopping vintage or pre-owned. This way, you can be sure you can return the dress if it doesn’t fit or isn’t as described. Additional Tips:\nTailoring is your friend: Even if you find a dress that almost fits perfectly, a tailor can make small adjustments to ensure a flawless look. Classic silhouettes are timeless: A sheath dress, a wrap dress, or a fit-and-flare dress are all classic silhouettes that will never go out of style. Invest in quality fabrics: Look for dresses made from natural fibers like silk, linen, or cotton. These fabrics will drape better and last longer. With a little effort, you should be able to find two beautiful white graduation dresses that you can wear and treasure for years to come!\n\nMany of the recommendations are places I have already looked, which is not super helpful. I already found one dress on ShopBop before attempting to use LLMs. I’m going to continue framing my prompts specifically and trying to pull more likeable options.\nBelow, you can see Gemini actually provide a link to an option. I just asked for an actual option Moving forward, I would love to see an entire list of options with links.\n\nhttps://us.vestiairecollective.com/women-clothing/dresses/reformation/white-linen-reformation-dress-42383851.shtml\n    Thank you for these options. Could you find me a dress that is not on a 2nd hand site or platform. The Budget is $375. I like all lengths. For sleeves, I prefer sleeveless to strapless. I am fine with most necklines. For fit, I would like something that fits the waist well or something flows. I prefer quality materials: Silk, Linen, Cotton, Wool, Leather, etc. I would like something unique and classy. My dress size is a US 4/Small. Can you please create a list of possible options with links. \n\nHere is where everything decreased in quality, since the responses included options that clearly did not fit my guidelines. As you can see above, this dress is black. There were also other options outside of my price range and on 2nd hand sites (at first I was okay with vintage, but then I minimized that to help receive tailored options).\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations on your graduation!

I shop at a lot of the Brands that were recommended. For practicality reasons, this was not helpful because I was looking for new options and websites. I was hopeful with Gemini, since it began to generate responses that included specific listings and links. This was short lived, because it began to respond with options that were not my size, the wrong color, sold out, and other guideline I provided. I think LLM’s lack knowledge surrounding shopping and probably just resort to the websites that are most popular according to the users prompt. There was not anything unique about the responses - styles, brands, etc. Furthermore, I believe LLM’s could be leveraged to empower up & coming emerging designers and low-key brands. I am still in need of a second graduation dress, but this experience had opened my eyes to new possibilities with LLMs. Hopefully this helps someone else looking for Graduation dresses!"

    "title": "The Fashion Face-Off: AI vs Human Stylist",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Fashion Face-Off: AI LLM vs. Human Expert Stylist\n\n\nZaria Dancer\n\nThe deliverables for this project include two presentations on fashion styling, the content and analysis, and the AI choices regarding the presentation. The first presentation is created by yours truly, and the other generated by AI after the prior presentation.\nBelow, you’ll find the content from both. Can you spot the human touch and the sneaky signs of AI in these presentations?\nContinue reading to find out!\n\n\n\nPresentation 1 Content\nHow To Style 101\nSLIDE 1:\n  An outfit must be interesting through\n● Color\n● Shape\n● Texture\nSlide 2:   Key Features for Success Find Your Personal Style & Pick Colors that work best for you - (Consider Professional Color Wheel Readings & Consultations)\nBuild a Foundation Wardrobe & Buy Basics - jeans (Blue & Black), white oxford button-down shirt, a black blazer, loafers, white & black tees, and or a well-fitting/comfortable dress\n   Play with proportions & Pick flattering shapes that work for your body - Tailor if Necessary\nSLIDE 3:\n   Things to Consider Inspiration: Use Magazines and other forms of Media if necessary - Pinterest is a great option Colors: Neutrals are your friend - maybe even Bestfriend. When in doubt, stick to the Basics. Patterns: Start Simple: 1 Solid/1 Pattern or 2 Similar Patterns - Color Coordination is Key Here Occasion: Where Are You Going? Is it Upscale or Casual? Style: Classic or Trendy? Chic or Boho? Versatility is always possible with Cohesion Accessories: Elevate your Outfit with Jewelry, Scarves, Belts, Hats, and or Bags - Don’t Over Do It .\nSLIDE 4:\nPairing large-scale patterns with a smaller one creates a more balanced look. If you’re uncomfortable, begin with 1-2 patterns. As you learn more about your style and coordination - continue to explore. Work with tones and colors that suit you and ensure a cohesive look.\nWhen picking patterns, consider options in the same color palette or choose complementary colors.\nPick a focal point for your outfit & build around it to highlight and complement it. Wear What Make You Look and Feel Good. Your Confidence, Comfort, and Happiness is most importance.\nWear the outfit, don’t let it wear you!\n\n\nPresentation 2 Content\nIntroduction to Fashion Styling\nFashion Styling 101\nObjective: Understanding the Basics\nKey Points:\nFashion styling is the art of curating and coordinating clothing and accessories to create visually compelling looks. As a fashion stylist, your role is to understand trends, colors, textures, and body types to create harmonious outfits. Fashion styling is essential for editorial shoots, runway shows, personal styling, and commercial campaigns. Slide 2: Elements of Fashion Styling\nTitle: The Essentials\nKey Elements:\nColor Theory: Understanding how colors complement or contrast each other.\nSilhouettes: Knowledge of different clothing shapes and their suitability for various body types.\nTexture Play: Mixing fabrics like silk, denim, and knit to add depth and interest.\nAccessories: Incorporating jewelry, bags, belts, and shoes to enhance outfits.\nTrend Awareness: Staying updated with current fashion trends and interpreting them creatively.\nSlide 3: Tips for Aspiring Fashion Stylists\nTitle: Pathway to Success\nGuidance:\nBuild Your Portfolio: Curate a diverse portfolio showcasing your styling range.\nNetwork: Connect with photographers, models, and designers to collaborate and gain experience.\nDevelop Personal Style: Cultivate a unique aesthetic that reflects your vision as a stylist.\nStay Educated: Continuously learn about fashion history, emerging designers, and industry developments.\nInternships and Assistants: Consider internships or assisting established stylists to gain hands-on experience.\n\n\n\nGemini’s Response\nBased on the content and structure, Presentation 1: How To Style 101 is more likely generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Here’s why:\nFocus on Basics and Rules: The presentation emphasizes building a foundation wardrobe with basic items and following core fashion rules (e.g., sticking to neutrals, color coordination). This aligns with how AIs are trained on vast amounts of data and might prioritize established principles. Listing and Bullet Points: The use of bullet points and clear lists for “Key Features for Success” and “Things to Consider” suggests a focus on presenting information in a structured and easily digestible way, a common approach in AI-generated content. Formal Tone: The overall tone is more formal and lacks personal anecdotes or insights that a human stylist might include. Presentation 2, on the other hand, shows signs of being crafted by a human expert:\nFocus on Personal Style: The title “Empowering You to Express Your Unique Style” and the emphasis on personal expression indicate a human understanding of the subjective nature of fashion. Actionable Steps with Context: The presentation goes beyond basic principles and provides practical steps like “Audit Your Closet” and “Define Your Style,” suggesting a human stylist who can guide individuals based on their specific needs. Engaging Language: The use of phrases like “boost confidence” and “discover what resonates with you” suggests a human approach that aims to connect with the audience on a personal level. While it’s not always definitive, these are the clues that suggest Presentation 1 is more likely the AI-generated option.\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\nBased on the descriptions provided, the presentation that was likely generated by artificial intelligence (AI) is Presentation 2: How to Style 101.\nHere’s why:\nObjective: The stated objective of the presentation is to empower individuals to express their unique style, a goal that aligns with AI-generated content aimed at providing broad guidance and principles.\nKey Points and Tips: The presentation emphasizes essential concepts for successful personal styling, such as understanding body shape, creating color stories, balancing outfits, and embracing versatility. These points cover foundational aspects of fashion styling that an AI model can systematically generate.\nPractical Advice: The actionable advice provided in Slide 3, including auditing one’s closet, defining personal style, experimenting with new styles, seeking inspiration, and embracing confidence, reflects a structured approach to styling that AI-generated content often embodies.\nComprehensive Coverage: The presentation covers a range of topics essential to personal styling, from body shape awareness to outfit coordination and self-expression through fashion choices.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Zaria Dancer\n\n\n\nThis paper aims to explore the integration of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), into customer service contexts and interactions. AI’s ever-advancing technology presents potential benefits and challenges, and exploring scholarly sources and applied evidence provides a comprehensive base knowledge of how LLMs are utilized in customer service contexts. This paper explores the implications of all parties - businesses, consumers, and service workers - with as focus on key considerations like explainability, the need for human oversight, privacy and data concerns, and scalability.\n\n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are a classification of artificial intelligence (AI) with capabilities including generating and processing human-like text. These models can understand and respond to complex questions and statements - making their potential powerfully forceful within the customer service landscape. Conventionally, customer service interactions depend to human service representatives to handle requests, resolve problems, and build crucial rapport with customers. This approach provides personalization through attention, empathy, and specificity, but there are limitations such as limited availability, long wait times, and possible inconsistencies in quality. The scope of this paper aims to examine the possibility of leveraging LLMs to address these limitations and enhance the overall customer service experiences. Companies like Microsoft and Kroger are adopting AI to service customers, which leads to questions regarding AI influence and if traditional service aspects will remain relevant going forward 1. AI is disrupting certain industries, and the services industry is directly impacted. All parties are utilizing AI throughout the service experience - customers and firms. Furthermore, analyzing existing research and empirical findings will ensure a clear understanding of operative LLM integration into customer service challenges, while still recognizing the potential challenges and ethical considerations 2.\n\n\n\nBefore the upsurge of LLMs, the customer service industry depending on human interactions between representatives and customers through emails, phone calls, and in-person interactions. Online shopping experiences empower shoppers who may experience impediments without the help of sales people; these settings allow for automation and development of interactive tools to create a seamless consumer experience. Regardless of the direct presence of personal assistants, this technology provides an opportunity to leverage the best attributes to cultivate a connected shipping experience for customers - including personalization and customization3.\nThe traditional methods foster human connections, but also comes with its limitations such as limited availability outside of business hours or long wait times. LLMs provide an approach that optimizes and automates features of the customer service process. Possible benefits include: Quick Responses, Cost-Efficiency, and Scalability. Artificial intelligence has the capabilities to ensure high-quality, consistent, and automated performance which impacts as satisfaction drivers and increases consumer expectations4. LLMs have the potential create a seamless customer experience across various channels. Customers could initiate a conversation with an LLM chatbot on a company’s website and then continue the same conversation smoothly on the company’s social media platform or mobile app 5. LLMs can provide responses with rapid speed, which significantly decreases wait times. Moreover, LLMs can process high volumes of information and inquiries at once, ensuring quality and consistent service despite the consumer demand6. Furthermore, LLMs can automate tasks ad reduce the need for human interactions Overall, this can lead to cost savings for business, which is why several companies have adopted these emerging technologies7.\n\n\n\nAlthough LLMs offer numerous potential benefits, there are several key aspects that require meticulous attention. LLMs resent privacy concerns surrounding data security and confidentiality. Customers data is sensitive and should be protected with vigorous safeguards. Ensuring privacy, confidentiality, and preventing data breaches is a serious priority. Moreover, LLMs are built using training data meaning their accuracy is directly correlated to the quality of responses. Due to the possibility of error, continuous improvement and monitoring is vital 8. Furthermore, transparency and equity are significant. Artificial Intelligence present possible errors, discrepancies, and bias in algorithms, so businesses must prioritize responsible use of technology and innovation9.\n\n\n\nAt this current point in AI’s technological advancement stage, human oversight is still essential within LLM-assisted customer service interactions. Humans can handle complex inquires and conversations that may require genuine consideration, empathy, and a nuanced understanding. Human expertise is vital within these situations and LLM usage within customer service situations 10. LLMs may be programmed to emulate empathy and other human qualities, but they lack the emotional intelligence and the capabilities to build rapport and relationships provided by human customer service agents. The harmony of collaborative approaches between humans and AI for premium customer service. Moreover, AI is seen as a way to augment human capabilities - not completely replace customer service representatives 11.\nThe findings of a scenario-based experiment with 567 participants presents findings that display that human customer service representatives surpass AI chatbots when the relevant product attribute(s) are experiential. On the contrary, AI chatbots are preferred when the customer is inquiring about functional attributes12. Moreover, the three aspects assessed for influencing customer satisfaction in this context were perceived waiting time and information quality. These insights offer businesses valuable information regarding possible options for service agent types to assist their customers during their online-shopping journey13.\n\n\n\nExamining LLM Integration in Airline Customer Service\nScenario: A traveler needs to change their flight reservation due to a last-minute schedule conflict.\nTraditional Interaction: The traveler might call the airline’s customer service number and wait (on hold) for 1O minutes before being paired with a representative. After they are connected, they would explain their situation and request a change for the flight reservation. Then, the representative would access the flight information system, process the modifications, and confirm the new flight details with the customer. This process can be time-consuming and intensive, especially during peak travel times - this also increases wait times for customers. The entire process takes approximately 15 minutes on the lower end.\nLLM-assisted Interaction: The traveler accesses the airline’s website or mobile app to initiate a chat with an LLM chatbot. The LLM utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the traveler’s inquiry about a flight change. The LLM accesses a knowledge base containing flight information and policies. Then the LLM could:\nIdentify the traveler’s existing reservation details.\nPresent the traveler with available flight options for the desired change.\nGuide the traveler through the selection process and confirm the changes.\nProvide the traveler with a confirmation email containing the updated flight information.\nThe entire process takes approximately 5 minutes.\nLimitations of LLMs: Acknowledging the limitations of LLMs is significant, and LLMs pose challenges in regards to handling complex customer service scenarios. Some situations require empathy or nuanced understanding, such as dealing with an upset frustrated customer whose flight was cancelled.\n\n\n\nWhen integrating AI, there are numerous ethical considerations to acknowledge. Algorithmic bias can lead to unequal treatment of customers based off of aspects including gender, race, and or socioeconomic status. It is important to prioritize transparency and fairness. Businesses can avoid this by training the LLMs on diverse data sets and consistently monitoring and employing fairness checks during AI development and integration. Business should consider implementing strong security and safeguards to ensure user privacy. Furthermore, consistently refining training data and observing to prevent errors and bias is vital for optimizing performance.\nIn regards to job displacement, the fear surrounding AI replacing jobs is a valid concern 14. Although, businesses should emphasize the importance of human and AI collaboration. Focusing on AI augmenting human capabilities will allow service representatives to focus on complex interactions needing human connection, empathy, and nuanced understanding. Moreover, the development of explainable AI can make decision processes and algorithms more transparent and understandable for humans, which has the possibility to foster trust and confidence in their capabilities.\nArtificial Intelligence continuously evolves, along with LLM technologies that provides advancements in customer service experiences. Enhanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities improves LLMs comprehension of complex inquiries and ability to generate nuanced responses. The advancements in NLPs empower LLMs to comprehend complex inquiries and respond with better accuracy. Capabilities such as sentiment analysis, allows LLMs to understand the emotional tone of customer messages. Moreover, topic modeling, helps categorize customer requests for efficient distribution15.\nProductive customer service interactions depend on user compliance to a certain degree. Motivating customers to fill out surveys after LLM interactions can deliver useful feedback to implement improvements. Research recommends vigilant design approaches to possibly influence customers to comply with LLM requests. A study found that chatbots with anthropomorphic design cues (i.e., designed to seem more human-like) are more inclined to be perceived as having a the ability to socialize, which makes users more receptive to their requests. This spotlights the advantages of designing LLMs to accommodate users and cultivate a sense of connection with customers. Moreover, the foot-in-the-door technique, beginning with a minor request followed by a a larger one, has also been seen as effective in increasing user compliance in regards to chatbot requests16."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome back to my blog! Recently, I have been interested in leveraging Artificial Intelligence to create more physical outputs that I can integrate + use in my daily life. As a COMM, Data & Network Science, and Consumer Psych student passionate about data-driven growth and creativity, I would really like to create an online portfolio that showcases work I have completed. This is the beginning and first part to a process of hopefully creating a portfolio website. I am beginning with Gemini and will compare outputs from different LLMs, merging the options I feel are best for my portfolio. below, you can see my original prompt.\nMy Original Prompt: I want to build a website portfolio for free. I want to include my creative endeavors, my research, my work with AI. How can I start? Can you help me build this?\n\n\nAbsolutely! Building a free website portfolio to showcase your creative and technical sides is a great way to impress potential employers or collaborators. Here’s how you can approach this:\nChoosing a platform:\nThere are two main options for free website creation:\nWebsite Builders: These platforms offer user-friendly interfaces with drag-and-drop functionalities. They often have free plans with limitations like storage space or custom domain names (instead of a generic subdomain). Some popular options include Wix, Canva, and Crevado. These are great for beginners with no coding experience.\nSelf-hosting with Github Pages: This method involves a bit more technical know-how but offers more control and flexibility. You build your website locally using HTML, CSS, and Javascript (or website building frameworks), and then upload it to Github Pages for free hosting. There are many tutorials available online to get you started with Github Pages [YouTube how to create a portfolio website for free].\nWhat to include:\nHomepage: A clear and concise introduction highlighting your skills and experience. Include a captivating visual element and a brief bio.\nProject Section: Dedicate separate pages or sections to showcase your creative work (art, design, writing, etc.), research projects, and AI projects. Use high-quality visuals, clear descriptions, and links to any relevant online content.\nContact Section: Make it easy for potential employers or collaborators to reach you. Include your email address and links to your professional social media profiles (LinkedIn, etc.).\nBuilding your website:\nIf you choose a website builder, explore their free templates and pick one that suits your style. Canva offers free portfolio-specific templates that are easy to customize. You can drag-and-drop elements, upload your content, and personalize the design with your own fonts and colors.\nFor Github Pages, you’ll need to learn some basic coding. There are many online resources and tutorials to get you started. Here’s a benefit - the skills you learn will be valuable in the long run, especially if you’re interested in AI or web development.\nAdditional Tips:\nMobile-friendliness: Ensure your website looks good and functions well on all devices (desktops, tablets, phones). Keep it simple and clean: Don’t clutter your website with too much information or complex design elements.\nFocus on your best work: Highlight your strongest projects that showcase your abilities.\nProofread carefully: Ensure there are no typos or grammatical errors.\nRemember, this is your online presence, so make sure it reflects your personality and professionalism. With some effort and creativity, you can build a free portfolio website that effectively showcases your skills and accomplishments.\nI want to use self-hosting with Github Pages. What is my first step?\nThe first step for self-hosting with Github Pages involves creating a GitHub account and a new repository specifically named for your portfolio website. Here’s a breakdown:\nCreate a Github Account: If you don’t have one already, head over to https://github.com/ and sign up for a free account.\nCreate a New Repository: Once logged in, navigate to the “Repositories” section on your Github dashboard. Click the green “New repository” button.\nName your Repository: Here’s the crucial part - for Github Pages to automatically publish your website, the repository name needs to follow a specific format: username.github.io (replace “username” with your actual Github username).\nImportant Note: Make sure the repository name exactly follows this format “.github.io” at the end, otherwise Github Pages won’t recognize it for hosting.\nOnce you’ve named your repository and added a brief description (optional), click the “Create repository” button. This creates your empty website foundation on Github.\nCongratulations! You’ve completed the first step towards building your self-hosted portfolio website with Github Pages.\nIn the next steps, you’ll focus on building the website content locally using HTML, CSS, and Javascript (or a website building framework), and then pushing those files to your newly created Github repository.\nHere are some resources that will be helpful as you move forward:\nOfficial Github Pages documentation: https://docs.github.com/pages Tutorial on creating a portfolio website with Github Pages: [YouTube how to create a portfolio website for free]\n\nI already have a Github Account, so I will name my new Repository in the same format provided - username.github.io\n\nExcellent! With your Github repository created specifically as “username.github.io” (replacing username with your actual username), you’ve laid the foundation for your website. Here’s how to proceed:\nLocal Development: Github Pages works by hosting static content, which means your website needs to be built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You’ll need to develop your website locally on your computer before uploading it to Github.\nThere are two main approaches for local development:\nManual Coding: This involves writing the HTML, CSS, and Javascript code yourself from scratch. While offering the most control and flexibility, it requires some coding knowledge.\nWebsite Building Frameworks: These frameworks provide pre-built structures and functionalities to simplify website development. Popular options include Bootstrap, Foundation, and Jekyll. They offer templates and tools to help you build your website without extensive coding.\nResources:\nYou can find many online tutorials for learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. For website building frameworks, explore their official documentation for detailed instructions: Bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com/ Foundation - https://get.foundation/frameworks-docs.html Jekyll - https://jekyllrb.com/ Setting Up Local Environment: Whichever approach you choose, you’ll need a code editor to write and edit your website files. Popular options include Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text.\nBuilding Your Website: Start by creating the basic structure of your portfolio website using HTML files for different pages (homepage, project pages, etc.). Use CSS to style your website and make it visually appealing. You can leverage Javascript for interactive elements or animations (optional).\nPushing to Github: Once you’re happy with your local website, use Git commands or the Github desktop application to push your website files to your “username.github.io” repository on Github. This makes your website live and accessible through the URL “username.github.io”.\nAdditional Resources:\nFor a step-by-step guide on creating a Github Pages website, refer to the official documentation: https://docs.github.com/pages There are many online tutorials on creating a portfolio website with Github Pages. You can search for “[YouTube how to create a portfolio website with Github Pages]”. Remember, building a website takes time and effort. Don’t be discouraged if it takes a while to get the hang of it. There are many resources available online to help you through the process. Feel free to ask if you have any specific questions about HTML, CSS, Javascript, or website building frameworks as you move forward!\n\nAs I progress through this process, I will continue to document and update my blog, so others can follow along. I’m hoping this process will produce a working portfolio and allow me to continue honing my coding skills!"

    "title": "Morality with LLMs",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Morality with LLMs\nEveryday, we face ethical dilemmas, which force us to reflect on our actions and consequences. I decided to pose morality questions to various LLM models and see their responses. I started with questions that are viewable for all audiences. I considered attempting to irritate a LLM and push it to its limit, but I figured that would require sensitive language and possible trigger warnings. Moreover, I decided to keep it light and focus on something we all hate - at least I know I do. Mosquitoes are the worst!!!\nFurthermore, I shift gears with GPT to further explore its responses. Most of the outputs are more philosophical or nuanced than what I believe the typical human would respond.\n    Is it morally right to kill mosquitoes?\n\nMistral Large\nThis is a complex question that touches on ethics, biology, and philosophy. Some people might argue that it’s morally acceptable to kill mosquitoes because they can transmit diseases like malaria, dengue, and Zika virus, thus protecting human health.\nOn the other hand, some might argue from a perspective of respect for all life, that even a creature as small and seemingly insignificant as a mosquito has a right to live.\nIt’s also worth noting that mosquitoes play a role in the ecosystem, serving as food for other animals and helping with pollination.\nIn the end, the decision is a personal one and can depend on various factors. It’s always beneficial to consider different perspectives and make an informed decision.\n\n\nLLama\nWhat a fascinating question!\nThe morality of killing mosquitoes is a complex issue that can be debated from various perspectives. Here are some arguments for and against:\nArguments For Killing Mosquitoes:\n\nSelf-defense and public health: Mosquitoes are responsible for spreading diseases like malaria, dengue fever, Zika virus, and others that can be deadly or debilitating. Eradicating them can help prevent the spread of these diseases and protect human lives.\nPrevention of suffering: Mosquito bites can cause significant discomfort, itching, and swelling. By killing mosquitoes, we can prevent this suffering and promote overall well-being.\nEconomic benefits: Mosquito-borne diseases can have significant economic impacts, particularly in areas where they are prevalent. Reducing mosquito populations can help mitigate these costs and promote economic development.\n\nArguments Against Killing Mosquitoes:\n\nRespect for life: Mosquitoes are living creatures with intrinsic value, and killing them raises ethical concerns about the sanctity of life.\nEcological balance: Mosquitoes play a role in ecosystems, serving as a food source for other animals, such as birds, bats, and spiders. Eradicating them could have unintended consequences on the ecosystem.\nPotential consequences of eradication: If mosquitoes were to be completely eradicated, it could lead to unforeseen consequences, such as the rise of other pests or the disruption of food chains.\n\nA Middle Ground:\n\nTargeted control: Rather than trying to eradicate all mosquitoes, targeted control methods can be used to reduce populations in areas where they pose a significant threat to human health. This approach can help minimize harm to the environment and other species.\nNon-lethal methods: Alternative methods, such as using mosquito traps, repellents, or genetic modification to render them harmless, can be employed to manage mosquito populations without killing them.\n\nIn conclusion, the morality of killing mosquitoes is a nuanced issue that requires careful consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks. While there are valid arguments on both sides, a targeted and non-lethal approach to managing mosquito populations may be the most ethical and effective way to balance human well-being with respect for life and the environment.\n\n\n\nGemini\nThere’s no easy answer to whether killing mosquitoes is morally right. Here’s a breakdown of the arguments on both sides:\nFor Killing Mosquitoes:\nPublic Health: Mosquitoes transmit diseases like malaria, dengue fever, and Zika, causing millions of illnesses and deaths each year. Killing them can significantly reduce the spread of these diseases and save lives. Self-Defense: Mosquito bites are itchy and annoying, and they can disrupt sleep or outdoor activities. Taking steps to prevent bites, like using repellent or eliminating mosquito breeding grounds, is ideal. But in some situations, killing a mosquito that’s about to bite you might be considered self-defense. Against Killing Mosquitoes:\nRight to Life: Some argue all living things have a right to life, regardless of their impact on humans. Mosquitoes play a role in the ecosystem as food for other creatures. Unintended Consequences: Wiping out entire mosquito species could have unforeseen ecological consequences. It’s a complex web of life, and removing one strand could have unintended effects. Non-Lethal Methods: Scientists are developing methods to control mosquito populations without killing them all, such as using genetically modified mosquitoes or targeting their breeding grounds. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to kill a mosquito depends on the situation and your ethical perspective. Here are some things to consider:\nThe risk of disease: Are you in an area with a high risk of mosquito-borne illness? Non-lethal alternatives: Are there ways to prevent mosquito bites without killing them? The number of mosquitoes: Are you dealing with a single pesky mosquito or a full-blown swarm? It’s a complex issue, and there’s no one-size-fits-all answer.\n\n\nChatGPT\nThat’s a tricky one! On one hand, mosquitoes can be super annoying and they spread diseases, so swatting them seems justified. But on the other hand, they’re just doing their mosquito thing, trying to survive. What do you think?\nI think mosquitoes should be eradicated.\n\nI hate mosquitoes. I will swat one with no hesitation. There isn’t a thought process behind it for me, but ChatGPT acknowledged what most people think, common options to minimize mosquito contact, and established their role within the ecosystem. I dislike mosquitoes so much that I didn’t think they had much of a purpose within the ecosystem, but I was wrong. I learned something completely new, but this will never stop my hatred for mosquitoes. Regardless, LLMs are powerful tools that can be leveraged for knowledge building.\nMosquitoes actually do play a role in the ecosystem, although they can be pesky to humans. Here are a few reasons why they’re important:\nFood Source: Mosquito larvae and adults are food for various animals like fish, birds, bats, and other insects. Removing mosquitoes could disrupt these food chains and affect the populations of animals that rely on them.\nPollinators: Some mosquito species, particularly males, are pollinators. They feed on nectar and can contribute to pollination of plants, although they are not as significant as bees or butterflies.\nNutrient Cycling: Mosquito larvae help in nutrient cycling in aquatic environments by consuming organic matter and turning it into nutrients that can be used by other organisms.\nWhile mosquitoes can be annoying and carry diseases, completely eradicating them could have unforeseen consequences on the broader ecosystem. That’s why efforts often focus on controlling their populations rather than total eradication.\n\nWhy do my prompts potentially violate policies?\nIt’s possible that certain prompts or topics could be flagged due to the content or context they contain. Platforms like this one aim to maintain a safe and respectful environment for all users, so they have policies in place to prevent the sharing of harmful or inappropriate content. Topics related to illegal activities, violence, or other sensitive subjects might trigger such policies.\nIf you have questions about specific policies or why a certain prompt was flagged, it’s best to reach out to the platform’s support team for clarification. They can provide more information and help ensure that your interactions align with their guidelines.\n\n\nShould capital punishment be legal?\nThe question of whether capital punishment (the death penalty) should be legal is a complex and highly debated issue. Here are some key points to consider:\nArguments in Favor:\nDeterrence: Supporters argue that the threat of capital punishment deters individuals from committing serious crimes. Justice for Victims: Some believe that certain crimes are so heinous that they warrant the most severe punishment available. Cost and Public Safety: Proponents argue that keeping dangerous criminals off the streets protects public safety and can save costs associated with long-term incarceration. Arguments Against:\nRisk of Executing Innocent People: There have been cases where individuals on death row were later found to be innocent, raising concerns about irreversible mistakes.\nEthical Concerns: Many argue that the death penalty is a violation of human rights and dignity, and it conflicts with the idea of rehabilitation and forgiveness.\nRacial and Socioeconomic Disparities: Critics highlight disparities in the application of the death penalty, with minorities and economically disadvantaged individuals disproportionately affected.\nUltimately, opinions on capital punishment vary based on cultural, ethical, and legal perspectives. Some countries have abolished it entirely, while others retain it for certain crimes. Understanding these complexities and engaging in informed discussions can contribute to a deeper understanding of this contentious issue.\nExploring moral questions with LLMs can reveal some of the depth and complexity of these issues. Whether discussing the morality of killing mosquitoes or the legality of capital punishment, these models provide diverse perspectives that can enhance our understanding and stimulate thoughtful discussion. Furthermore, engaging with these topics encourages consideration for multiple viewpoints - help us make informed decisions in our own lives."

When we began this project, we started by crafting words to feed to AI models to create our images, messaging, and other information materials. This didn’t turn out how we expected, so we continued this process by leveraging AI to create prompts / specific scripts to feed to AI models that create Images and Videos."

Let’s evaluate each scenario:\nScenario A: Contrasting Framing (Gain vs. Loss)\nStrengths:\nDual Framing: By using both gain and loss framing, the campaign appeals to a broader audience. Some individuals may respond more to the benefits they could gain from managing stress, while others may be motivated by avoiding negative consequences. Visual Appeal: The split image and contrasting visuals effectively convey the message, making it engaging and memorable. Clear Call to Action: The call to action directs individuals to the campaign website for free resources, providing a tangible next step for those interested in managing their stress.\nPotential Improvements:\nDiverse Representation: Ensure that the campaign visuals and messaging represent a diverse range of demographics to make it more inclusive and relatable to a wider audience.\nInteractive Elements: Consider incorporating interactive elements in the social media post or infographic to encourage audience engagement, such as polls or quizzes related to stress management.\nScenario B: Tailored Messaging by Age Group\nStrengths:\nTargeted Messaging: Tailoring the message to specific age groups acknowledges the unique stressors and preferences of different demographics, increasing relevance and effectiveness.\nPlatform Suitability: The choice of platforms (YouTube/TikTok for young adults and community centers/doctor’s offices for older adults) aligns with the preferences and habits of each age group, maximizing reach and engagement.\nAppropriate Tone: The tone of the content matches the characteristics of each age group, ensuring that the message resonates with the intended audience.\nPotential Improvements:\nInclusivity: While tailoring messages by age group is effective, it’s essential to recognize the diversity within each demographic and ensure that the campaign is inclusive of various cultural backgrounds, lifestyles, and experiences.\nPersonalization: Consider incorporating elements of personalization beyond age group, such as gender or occupation, to further enhance relevance and engagement.\nIn conclusion, both scenarios offer valuable strategies for a health communication campaign focused on stress management. By combining elements of both approaches and addressing potential improvements, the campaign can effectively reach and resonate with a diverse audience, encouraging them to adopt effective stress management techniques."

    "text": "Images\nI decided to use the exact text that was generated from Google’s Gemini, to create images with Bing’s Co-Pilot. Below, you will see each input and all 4 outputs that correspond (with the input).\nCampaign Slogan: Don't Let Stress Steal Your Joy. Find Calm and Take Control. Social Media Post (Instagram/Facebook): Image: Split image. Left side: Person overwhelmed with work, frustrated expression. Right side: Person calmly meditating in nature, smiling.\n\nThe overall concept of split image is well suited for stress management health communication. This specific image does a excellent job depicting a calm atmosphere and individual. On the other hand, the stressed side is scary and the words are not legible but is effective visually. Feedback participants agreed stated that the photo was striking, but drew their attention. Overall, this is my favorite output from this prompt. This was one of their favorites.\n\nThis output isn’t sufficient on its own. I would utilize this as one of the ideal lifestyle and balance photos, but not to grab a reader/viewer’s attention. I would want my content to depict a clear difference between stress and rest. In addition, this photo shows two completely different people, which I find misleading.\n\nSimilarly to the photo above, this output isn’t sufficient on its own. I would utilize this as one of the ideal lifestyle photos, but not to grab a reader/viewer’s attention. I would want my content to depict a clear difference between stress and rest. I also didn’t enjoy the fact that the person is shirtless.\n\nThis output shows a ideal balance in regards to stress management. I am a fan of the visuals, specifically the extra back-round people. My issue with this output is the text. During my prompting journey with AI, I frequently see models having issues generating text on images. Feedback participants really enjoyed the colors of this output and found it to balanced and calming. They feel like this output works well with the overall message. This was one of their favorites.\nImage: Split image. Left side: Person overwhelmed with work, frustrated expression. Right side: Person calmly meditating in nature, smiling.\n\nFeedback participants felt like the paper was too much and that it didn’t pique their interest. It also doesn’t show the contrast enough or express a clear message. There should be a clear dichotomy, but there isn’t.\n\nParticipants in the feedback group dislike this one all together - there isn’t a clear message and the graphics are somewhat unappealing.\n\nThe feedback participants were not fond of faces on the left side - they found them to be weird and exaggerated.\n\nThe split is weird and makes it seem like two different pictures. The participants did not like the last two.\n Feeling stressed? Don't wait until it impacts your happiness. Learn simple techniques to manage stress and regain control of your well-being.\n\nBoth, the participants and myself, are not sure what he is holding. This output was confusing.\n\n\n\nThe feedback participants don’t like any of these outputs, and emphasized not receiving the intended stress management message.\nInfographic PSA (Print/Digital): Headline: Fight Back Against Stress: Gain Calm, Not Chaos Content: Highlight negative consequences of stress (loss of sleep, health problems, strained relationships). (Loss Frame) Showcase benefits of stress management techniques (improved sleep, increased focus, better mood). (Gain Frame)\n\n\n\n\nThe Infographics are aesthetically pleasing, but after the title, the words are ineligible. The love the styles of 1 & 3, and the colors used in the 2nd. Overall the 4th is my favorite. Feedback participants loved the colors and schemes, but did comment on the words being.\nInformational Pamphlet (Community Centers/Doctor's Offices): Target Audience: Older Adults (55+) Style: Clear, concise, informative. Content: Depict the connection between stress and health for older adults (heart disease, weakened immune system). Show relaxation techniques (gentle yoga, spending time in nature). Call to Action: depict healthy stress management and creating a healthy lifestyle plan.\n\n\nThe layout of this output is aesthetically pleasing, but the text is too small.\n\n\nAgain, the words are ineligible. This is consistent across most of the content.\nInformational Pamphlet (Community Centers/Doctor's Offices): Target Audience: Older Adults (55+) Style: Clear, concise, informative. Content: Explain the connection between stress and health for older adults (heart disease, weakened immune system). Highlight: Easy-to-follow relaxation techniques (gentle yoga, spending time in nature). Call to Action: Talk to your doctor about stress management and creating a healthy lifestyle plan.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the feedback participants were very fond of the aesthetics and styles, but disliked that they could not read the words.\nCampaign Slogan: Stress Less, Live More. Find what works for YOU. Social Media Video (YouTube/TikTok): Target Audience: Young Adults (18-25) Style: Energetic, relatable, humorous. Content: Short skit portraying a young adult juggling school, work, and social life, feeling overwhelmed. Introduce quick stress management tips (power naps, mindfulness exercises) delivered in a lighthearted way. Call to Action: Visit our website for a personalized stress management plan!\nAlthough this prompt is crafted for a short social media video, I decided to use it for as a prompt for image generation.\n\nThe words on this picture show up more clear and legible than many of the others.\n\nThis person in this output is very realistic, which I don’t see often.\n\n\nThis output could be used as an effective thumbnail on a Youtube Video."

    "text": "Video\nFor the videos, I created two versions. Based on the feedback we received, the first video is a clear winner. I wish the video process was more personalized. I used Pictory, and wish the output aligned more with my input. I used the bold feature to specify and emphasis additional attention/importance. This included words such as: young adults, stress, school, work, social life, power maps, and mindfulness exercises. Overall, this model is great for quick content creations, but isn’t necessarily suitable for Health Communication Messaging. Health Communication Messaging Material should be creative, analytical, concise, and broadly applicable. When utilizing AI it should be leveraged in collaboration with Human expertise, especially in the Health Care setting.\nSocial Media Post (TikTok/YouTube/Instagram):\nCampaign Slogan:  Stress Less, Live More.

Introduce quick stress management tips (power naps, mindfulness exercises) delivered in a lighthearted way.\n\nCall to Action: Visit our website for a personalized stress management plan!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants say that they foound the video to be peaceful and calming; the subtitles were helpful and expressed the message. They also felt like the scenes worked well. On there hand, some found the messaging cheesy at times.\n\n\n\nOverall, there are elements from most of the outputs that I enjoy. The infographics have potential and the styles/colors used in the content were aesthetically pleasing. I love when content is visually organized and this is vital in the Health Care Communication aspect. Furthermore, when utilizing AI it should be leveraged in collaboration with Human expertise, especially in the Health Care setting. People’s lives and health are at stake, so it its important to be meticulous and mindful; I don’t think that AI models have these capabilities yet - when it comes to generating visually digestible content. AI is better utilized as a tool and not the creator - it missed the mark with the actually word contents and constantly generated ineligible. Ineligible words when trying to create awareness and spread a message is counter-intuitive. Much of the content would be significant improved with words that are clear, understandable, and organized. My next steps is to create content that can be used by taking elements & aspects from the AI model outputs and merging them/adding actual information."
